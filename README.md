# Topic Modeling with Gensim and spaCy

This repository contains Python code for performing topic modeling on text data using Gensim and spaCy. The code demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, creating bigrams and trigrams, lemmatization, building a corpus, training an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model, and evaluating the model using perplexity and coherence score.

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frtpynrc/London-Airbnb-Reviews-Topic-Modeling-LDA-.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script in your preferred environment.**

4. **Execute the code cells or run the script to perform topic modeling on your text data.**

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- re
- pprint
- gensim
- spacy
- pyLDAvis
- nltk

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
